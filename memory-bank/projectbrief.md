- Provide authenticated access for zonal admins, team leads, and singers.
- Host rehearsal media (audio/video) with a rich, mobile-friendly player experience.
- Offer scheduling, notifications, and performance analytics for events and sessions.
- Integrate with Supabase/Firebase backends plus payment/notification services.
